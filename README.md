## The Process of Writing a C Program

1. Write source codes (.c) and header files (.h)
2. Pre-process the source cordes according to the preprocessor directives. The preprocessor directives begin with a hash sign #
3. Compile the pre-processed source codes into object codes (.obj, .o)
4. Link the compiled object codes and library object codes (.lib, .a) to produce executable code (.exe)
5. Load the executable code into computer memory
6. Run the executable code
